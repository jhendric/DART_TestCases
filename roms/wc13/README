To test ROMS, you have to run observations/obs_converters/ROMS/work/quickbuild.csh
to build the ROMS precomputed forward operator program as well as all the normal
bits in models/ROMS/work/quickbuild.csh

This collection of files was created by simply running 
models/ROMS/shell_scripts/stage_experiment.csh  - all the ROMS-related bits
are in $USER == thoar.

From there, all you have to do is   bsub < cycle.csh
