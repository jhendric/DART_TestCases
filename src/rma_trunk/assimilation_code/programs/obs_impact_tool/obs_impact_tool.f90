!> other in a concise way.
!>
!> At run time, filter can read the output file from this tool

!> The first version of this tool requires the last numeric

! program to read an ascii file with directions for which state and observation
! KINDS should impact which other state and observation KINDS.

! the format of the ascii input file is:
!
! # rest of line is comment after hash mark
! GROUP groupname1
!  QTY_xxx  QTY_xxx  QTY_xxx
!  QTY_xxx
! END GROUP
!
! GROUP groupname2
!  QTY_xxx  QTY_xxx  QTY_xxx
!  QTY_xxx
! END GROUP
!
! GROUP groupnameM
! ALL EXCEPT QTY_xxx QTY_xxx
! QTY_xxx
! END GROUP
! # to choose all kinds except a select few
!
! # FIXME: this is not supported yet - should it be?  yes.
! GROUP groupnameN
! ALL EXCEPT groupnameY
! END GROUP
!
! also ALLTYPES, ALLKINDS, as well as ALL
!
! IMPACT
!  QTY_xxx    QTY_xxx     0.0
!  QTY_xxx    groupname1   0.0
!  groupname1  QTY_xxx     0.0
!  groupname1  groupname1   0.0
! END IMPACT

! # this also is not supported yet, should it be?
! GROUP groupnameX
! # not only kinds, but other groups, recursively?
!  different_groupname  # but what about loops?  even possible?
! END GROUP

! alternative output is triplets of 'kind1 kind2 value'
! which gets put into the 2d array at run time?  is that better?

! maybe prototype the application of these values inside assim_tools
! first before deciding what the output should be.  inside the
! filter run i think it should be a 2d array for speed, but is that
! the most flexible for input to filter?

! or finally, the input to this tool could be the ascii text file,
! and the 2d table could be computed and filled in the initialization
! code (if not too slow) and there is no separate tool needed?

! i started to add types, but they can only appear in column 1 of the
! triplet line.  rethink this.

! the output of this tool is a ascii file containing lines:
!  KIND1_string   KIND2_string    0.0
!
! the 2d table building will now be done at run time in assim_tools
! use would be if (impact_table(kind1, kind2) > 0.0) then ok else 
! change the increments. this could be done in assim_tools in a generic way.
