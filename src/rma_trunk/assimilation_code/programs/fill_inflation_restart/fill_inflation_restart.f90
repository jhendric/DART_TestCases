! THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN OBSOLETED by converting our restart files to
! NetCDF format.  you can assign a value with 'ncap2', one of the NCO
! utility program.  for now i'm going to leave the mkmf and path_names
! files around and the program will just print out a helpful message.
! in a few months/years we should remove this program entirely.
!
! here's an example of using ncap2 to set the T,U and V inf values:
!  ncap2 -s 'T=1.0;U=1.0;V=1.0' wrfinput_d01 prior_inf.nc
!  ncap2 -s 'T=0.6;U=0.6;V=0.6' wrfinput_d01 prior_sd.nc 
!
! this works as long as you have at least version 4.4.2 of the NCO utils.
! some earlier versions change the full 3d arrays into a single scalar.
! if you see this, get a more recent version of the nco tools.
