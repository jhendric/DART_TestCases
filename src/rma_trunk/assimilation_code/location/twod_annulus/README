A location consists of the pair (azimuth, radius).

This is copied from the cylindrical version of the
annulus location module which has an azimuthal angle,
a radius, and a height.

The location_mod.f90 requires the parameters inner_rad (inner
radius of the annulus) and outer_rad (outer radius of the annulus)
from the input.nml.

Azimuthal angle is in degrees, radius is in meters.
