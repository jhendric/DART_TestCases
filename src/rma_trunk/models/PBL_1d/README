The PBL_1D directory has been deprecated in favor of using the WRF/DART model
interface.  There is now support for WRF single column mode built into the
standard model_mod in that directory.

If you are interested in more information on this configuration, email us
at dart at ucar dot edu.

If you already have access to the DART Developers Wiki, look here:

https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/DARTdev/WRF+Single+Column+Model

If you really want the files that used to be in this directory, check them
out from the Kodiak release of DART.

Contact dart at ucar dot edu for more information or questions.
