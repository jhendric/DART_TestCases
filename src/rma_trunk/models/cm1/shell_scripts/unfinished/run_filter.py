# Script to start an MPI version of filter, and then optionally
# run the model advance if &filter_nml has async=4 (parallel filter
# AND parallel model).  This version gets the number of ensemble members
# and advance command out of the input.nml namelist file automatically.
# It also gets the async setting and sets serial vs parallel model
# automatically.  The theory is that once you get this script working on
# your system, you will not need to change anything here as you change the
# number of ensemble members, async setting, or model advance command.

## -q <arg>   Queue name (small, medium, long, verylong)
## -l nodes=xx:ppn=2   requests BOTH processors on the node. On both bangkok
