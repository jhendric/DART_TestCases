This externals directory is created to handle DART now being
distributed via subversion - this means that we will no longer be able
to track local revisions outside the COAMPS subdirectory.

This directory contains versioned files that are modified in the
external directory structure: location module, observation
definitions, etc.  These can either be copied/linked in the proper
directories, or mkmf can be modified to point to their current
location.
