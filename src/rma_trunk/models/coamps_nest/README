An updated version of the coamps model interfaces and scripts.
Contributed by Alex Reinecke, NRL, Monterey.

The primary differences from the original coamps model code are:

 - the ability to assimilate nested domains
 - assimilates real observations
 - a simplified way to specify the state vector
 - I/O COAMPS data files 
 - extensive script updates to accommodate additional HPC environments
