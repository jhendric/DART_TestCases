NetCDF File layout for DART/COAMPS

The NetCDF file layout for the DART/COAMPS model is relatively
straightforward - the state vector is stored as one long entity.

The state vector is defined with dimensions (time, copy, StateVariable).
Time and StateVariable should be fairly self-explanatory, but the copy
coordinate can differ depending on the DART configuration.

In true_state.nc, the length of the copy dimension is 1 - there is only
one truth.  In preassim.nc and analysis.nc, though, there are
more things to be stored:
Copy 1:         Ensemble mean
Copy 2:         Ensemble spread
Copy 3-(end-2): Ensemble member state vectors
                (note that this may be a subset of the actual ensemble:
                adjust how many are written out by changing the 
                num_output_state_members parameter in filter_nml)
Copy (end-1):   The mean of the inflation parameter (as estimated
                by the DART adaptive inflation procedure)
Copy (end):     The standard deviation of the inflation parameter
                (as estimated by the DART adaptive inflation procedure)

If the output_inflation parameter is set to false in filter_nml, the last
two entries will not be written, and the NetCDF file will contain only the
ensemble mean, spread, and [select] members.

To extract particular variables from the state vector, see the COAMPS
matlab subdirectory - this contains several routines that process the
restart.vars file that created the state vector to calculate the
entries corresponding to particular fields.
