The DART namelist is a subset of the COAMPS forecast namelist(s).  To
avoid having to allocate space for all the variables in the full
namelist, we run a program that reads in the full COAMPS namelist file
and a file containing the subset of variables that we want pulled
out.  This creates a second namelist file that contains only these
values.
