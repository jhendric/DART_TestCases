Possible bug found in model_mod.f90 for pop where set_date is sent sec this day the routine wants sec this min

use     dart_cice_mod, only: set_model_time_step,               &
                             get_horiz_grid_dims,               &
                             read_horiz_grid, read_topography,  &
                             get_cice_restart_filename


14 May 2016 - CMB diving in

created ../../obs_def/obs_def_cice_mod.f90 to make new obs_kinds used in model_mod.f90 and input.nml. Flailed around only. Not sure what to do.

not sure about KIND_TRACERARRAY_CATSp

edited ../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90 but should not have. It is supposed to be rewritten anyway. removed edits but date changed

CICE manual "The spatial discretization is specialized for a generalized orthogonal B-grid as in [51] or [63]. The ice and snow area, volume and energy are given at the center of the cell, velocity is defined at the corners, and the internal ice stress tensor takes four different values within a grid cell; bilinear approximations are used for the stress tensor and the ice velocity across the cell, as described in [33]. This tends to avoid the grid decoupling problems associated with the B-grid. " Hence:

U, V are at gridcell corners
T, h, hs, etc are at centers

I'll assume for now that the grid is identical to pop

!CMB I do not understand this part, leaving but may be unneeded in cice
INTERFACE vector_to_prog_var
      MODULE PROCEDURE vector_to_2d_prog_var
      MODULE PROCEDURE vector_to_3d_prog_var
END INTERFACE

subroutine vector_to_3d_prog_var(x, varindex, data_3d_array)
subroutine get_gridsize(num_x, num_y, num_z) ! not used in pop so of course not used now in cice either, why?


! CMB come back here, some changes made below but need to look line-by-line still
subroutine get_state_meta_data(state_handle, index_in, location, var_type)

dart_to_cice.f90 think it is done
cice_to_dart.f90 is trivial so hope it's done too
test_dipole_interp.f90 also trivial, nothing to change?
model_mod_check.f90

rma-cice/location/ has a bunch of subdirs each with a location_mod.f90

dart_cice_mod.f90 should it have a get_cat_dim?

in model_mod.f90 still have
!CMB I do not understand this part, but appears in clm too
