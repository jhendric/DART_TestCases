Here's the procedure for using perturbed sounding data:

(1) Go to DART/WRF/sounding_perturbation
(2) Modify pert_sounding.input
(3) Run pert_sounding
(4) In DART/WRF, create a directory with experiment number
(5) Move input_soundingxx files to (4)
    Note that if you're running a control experiment (as
    defined in prepare_ideal_IC script), base "input_sounding"
    file should also be present in (4)
(6) In "RUN_DIR" as defined in prepare_ideal_IC script,
    create a directory link "sounding_files" to the
    directory created in (4) - this will become the "SNDG_DIR"
    as defined in prepare_ideal_IC script
(7) In DART/WRF, run the prepare_ideal_IC script with the
    sounding perturbation option turned on


Here's a quick tip for checking output on Matlab:
(Remember that the code outputs an additional file "test_sounding.output".)

tt=load('test_sounding.output_exp53');
t=reshape(tt,[51 67 4]);
plot(std(squeeze(t(2:51,:,3)),0,1),'d-');grid on  % plots std dev of u as a function of height
