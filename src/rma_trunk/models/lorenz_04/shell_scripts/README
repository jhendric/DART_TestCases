coseq.pl generates a file that can be redirected into
create_obs_sequence.  It requires only two pieces of information 
from STDIN.  As it currently stands, it assumes that the output 
filename is set_def.out, and it assumes a single uniqe observation 
set.

The user inputs are the spacing between obs (the script figures
out the resulting observation locations under the assumption
that the first observation is at location 1) and the observational
variance (the script assumes all observations have the same error
variance).

After running this script, the user runs the command:

   ./create_obs_sequence < coseq.dat

coseq.pl should be moved into the work directory before being run.
