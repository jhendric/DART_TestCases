This directory contains general DART documentation, figure sources,
and release notes and backwards-compatible issues for the latest DART release.

The documentation for each of the components of DART are
located in the same directory as the corresponding source files.
See 'index.html' at the top level directory for a pointer
to all the html files in the system.

The 'boilerplate' directory contains files and programs for
generating documentation files.

If you are looking for release notes from a previous version
of DART check out a copy of this directory from the SVN repository
with a revision number of 6330 or earlier.

Thanks,
The DART Team
