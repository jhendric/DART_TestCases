++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Jan 13th 2017 :: rma_fixed_filenames merge changes.  Revision: 10902
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Specific namelist changes include:

1. ) Earlier versions of the RMA branch code supported both direct NetCDF 
     reads/writes and the original binary/ascii DART format restart files.  
     As of the next update DART format files are no longer supported.  All 
     I/O is NetCDF only.  If your model does not use NetCDF you will still 
     need a model_to_dart and dart_to_model converter; otherwise all DART 
     programs read the model's NetCDF files directly.  The namelist options 
     related to selecting direct netcdf I/O have been removed.

2. ) Diagnostic and state space data (such as inflation, mean and sd 
     information) that were previously stored in {Prior,Posterior}_Diag.nc 
     are now broken up into multiple files and have fixed filenames. This 
     decreases the IO time for diagnostic output and reduces the number of 
     namelist options.

3. ) There is no longer support for observation space inflation 
     (i.e. inf_flavor = 1).  Contact us at dart@ucar.edu if you have an 
     interest in using this option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the filter_nml are :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* restart_in_file_name      -- has been replaced with input_restart_file_list.
                               The namelist must contain one or more file names, 
                               each of which is a textfile containing a list of N 
                               NetCDF restart files, one per line for each ensemble member.
                               For models with multiple domains (e.g. nested WRF or 
                               CLM) you must specify a listfile for each domain.

* restart_out_file_name      -- has been replaced with output_restart_file_list.
                                Same format as input_restart_file_list.

* inf_in_file_name           -- REMOVED, now have fixed names of the form 
                                input_{prior,posterior}inf_{mean,sd}.nc

* inf_out_file_name          -- REMOVED, now have fixed names of the form 
                                output_{prior,posterior}inf_{mean,sd}.nc.

* inf_diag_filename          -- REMOVED

* inf_output_restart         -- REMOVED, inflation restarts will be written 
                                out if inflation is turned on

* output_inflation           -- REMOVED, inflation diagnostic files will be written 
                                if inflation is turned on

* stages_to_write            -- There is more control over what state data 
                                to write.  Options are at stages : 
                                'input', 'preassim', postassim', 'output'.  
                                Stages preassim and postassim will output 
                                state data originally contained within the 
                                copies of Prior_Diag.nc and Posterior_Diag.nc.
                                See rma_doc/rma.html for details on the 
                                filename conventions. For example, running 
                                filter with prior inflation enabled with 
                                stage 'preassim' enabled will produce files 
                                with names:
                                   preassim_member_####.nc
                                   preassim_{mean,sd}.nc
                                   preassim_priorinf_{mean,sd}.nc

* write_all_stages_at_end    -- important for large models - all output file 
                                I/O is deferred until the end of filter, but 
                                will use more memory to store the data.  More
                                detailed info is in rma_doc/rma.html

* output_restart_mean        -- renamed output_mean

* output_restart             -- renamed output_restarts

* direct_netcdf_{read,write} -- REMOVED, always true

* restart_list_file          -- renamed input_restart_file_list

* single_restart_file_in     -- renamed single_file_in

* single_restart_file_out    -- renamed single_file_out

* add_domain_extension       -- REMOVED

* use_restart_list           -- REMOVED

* overwrite_state_input      -- REMOVED, equivalent functionality can be set 
                                with single_restart_file_in = single_restart_file_out

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the perfect_model_obs_nml are :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* restart_in_filename        -- renamed restart_in_file_names takes a NetCDF 
                                file. For multiple domains you can specify a 
                                list.

* direct_netcdf_{read,write} -- REMOVED, always true

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the state_space_diag_nml are :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* single_file               -- REMOVED, diagnostic files are now controlled 
                               in filter_nml with stages_to_write

* make_diagnostic_files     -- REMOVED, no longer produce original
                               Prior_Diag.nc and Posterior_Diag.nc

* netCDF_large_file_support -- REMOVED, always true

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripting with CESM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See models/cam-fv/scripts_cesm1_5/assimilate.csh for an example of how to 
handle the new filename conventions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL NOTES :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* currently the closest_member_tool is broken but plans on being fixed soon.
* restart_file_tool and most model_to_dart/dart_to_model programs have been
  deprecated, since DART formated restarts are no longer supported.
* some programs such as model_mod_check have not been fully tested and need
  to be exercised with the new naming conventions.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Feb 15th 2017 :: rma_single_file merge changes.   Revision: 11136 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Filter and PMO can now run with multiple cycles for low order models. The output
for this is only supported with single file output (members, inflation, mean, sd
are all in the same file).

Added matlab support for diagnostics format in lower order models.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the filter_nml are :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

output_restart          -- RENAMED to output_members
restart_in_file_name    -- RENAMED to input_state_file_list
restart_out_file_name   -- RENAMED to output_state_file_list
single_restart_file_in  -- RENAMED to single_file_in
single_restart_file_out -- RENAMED to single_file_out

input_state_files       -- ADDED - not currently working
output_state_files      -- ADDED - not currently working

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Feb 15th 2017 :: filter updates.   Revision: 11160 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The postassim diagnostics file was being incorrectly written after
posterior inflation was applied.  It is now written immediately after
the assimilation update, and then posterior inflation, if enabled,
is applied.

Sampling Error Correction now reads data from a single netcdf file
for any ensemble size.  To add other sizes, a program can generate
any ensemble size and append it to this file.  The default file is
currently in system_simulation:

system_simulation/work/sampling_error_correction_table.nc

Filter and PMO no longer need the "has_cycling" flag.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the filter_nml are :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

has_cycling             -- REMOVED for low order models

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the perfect_model_obs_nml are :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

has_cycling           -- REMOVED for low order models

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ April 27th 2017 :: diagnostic file changes.  Revision: 11545
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Two additional Diagnostic Files (forecast and analysis) in Filter 
which can be set with the namelist option (stages_to_write)

  input    - writes out mean and sd if requested. for low order models
             mean and sd are only inserted into restart files with a 
             single time step.

  forecast - contains the forecast and potentially the mean and sd for the,
             this is mostly important for lower order models which cycle

  preassim - before assimilation
     * No Inflation:       same as forecast
     * Prior Inf:          the inflated ensemble and damped prior inf
     * Post Inf:           same as forecast
     * Prior and Post Inf: the inflated ensemble and damped prior inf

  postassim - after assimilation (before posterior infation)
     * No Inflation:       same as analysis
     * Prior Inf:          same as analysis
     * Post Inf:           assimilated ensemble and damped posterior inflation
     * Prior and Post Inf: assimilated ensemble and damped posterior inflation

  analysis - after assimilation and before potentially update posterior inflation ensemble 
             and updated prior inf
     * No Inflation:       assimilated ensemble
     * Prior Inf:          assimilated ensemble and updated prior inf
     * Post Inf:           post inflated ensemble and updated posterior inflation
     * Prior and Post Inf: post inflated ensemble and updated prior inf and posterior 
                           inflation

  output - a single time step of the output ensemble and potentially updated prior inf 
           and posterior inflation


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ May 5th 2017 :: major changes to model_mod interfaces.  Revision: 11615
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A long-awaited overhaul of the model_mod interfaces. All models which are
in our subversion repository and are supported in the Manhattan release
have been updated to match the new interfaces.  If you have model_mods with
extensive changes, our recommendation is to diff your changes with the version
you checked out and insert those changes into the new version.  The changes for
this update are unfortunately extensive.

The detailed list of changes: 

model_mod::get_state_meta_data() is no longer passed an ensemble_handle as the
first argument.  it should not do vertical coordinate conversion.  that will be
done as a separate step by convert_vertical_state()

model_mod::vert_convert is replaced by convert_vertical_state() and convert_vertical_obs()
Any vertical conversion code that was in get_state_meta_data should be moved
to convert_vertical_state() which has access to the state vector index, so the
code should move easily.

model_mod::query_vert_localization_coord is no longer a required interface
model_mod::get_close_maxdist_init is not longer a required interface
model_mod::get_close_obs_init is not longer a required interface

model_mod::get_close_obs has a different calling convention and is split into
get_close_obs() and get_close_state().  the close obs routine is passed both the
obs types and quantities, and the close state routine is passed both the
state quantities and the state index, for ease in vertical conversion if needed.

model_mod::nc_write_model_vars() is deprecated for now; it may return in a
slightly different form in the future.  

model_mod::nc_write_model_atts() is now a subroutine with different arguments.
it should now only write any global attributes wanted, and possibly some grid 
information.  it should NOT write any of the state variables; those will be 
written by DART routines.

model_mod::get_model_size() needs to return an i8 for the size.

A new module "default_model_mod" supplies default routines for any required
interfaces that don't need to be specialized for this model.

A new module "netcdf_utilities_mod" can do some simple netcdf functions for
you and we plan to add many more over the next couple months.

model_mod::get_model_time_step has been replaced by shortest_time_between_assimilations()
since in fact it has always controlled the minimum time filter would request a model advance
and never had anything to do with the internal time step of the dynamics of the model.

We have removed 'output_state_vector' from the namelist of all model_mods since
we no longer output a single 1d vector.  all i/o is now in netcdf format.

Models now have more control over when vertical conversion happens - on demand
as needed, or all up front before assimilation.

Models that were doing vertical conversion in get_state_meta_data should set:
&assim_tools_nml
   convert_all_state_verticals_first = .true.
   convert_all_obs_verticals_first = .true.

Models which were not should set:
   convert_all_state_verticals_first = .false.
   convert_all_obs_verticals_first = .true.

The location_mod::vert_is_xxx() routines have become a single is_vertical(loc, "string") where
string is one of: "PRESSURE", "HEIGHT", "SURFACE", "LEVEL", "UNDEFINED", "SCALE_HEIGHT"

Models doing vertical localization should add a call to set_vertical_localization_coord()
in their static_init_model() routine to tell dart what vertical coordinate system they
are expecting to convert to for vert localization

Most path_names_xxx files have been updated to add additional modules.  compare against
what is checked out to see the differences.

Some of the internal changes include pulling common code from the locations
modules into a location_io_mod which contains common functions for creating
and writing 'location' variables for any location type.

QTY_RAW_STATE_VARIABLE is redundant and was shortened to QTY_STATE_VARIABLE

Many utility programs use the template/model_mod.f90 because they don't
depend on any model-specific functions.  this file was also updated to
match the new interfaces.

The obs_impact facility is enabled in the assim_tools namelist. you can
use the obs_impact_tool to construct a table which prevents one class of
observations from impacting another class of state.

Sampling Error Correction now reads the values it needs from a single
netcdf file found in assimilation_code/programs/gen_sampling_err_table/work.
copy it to the same directory as where filter is running.  all ensemble
sizes which were previously in final_full.XX files are included, and there
is a tool to generate and append to the file any other ensemble size required.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Jun 2nd 2017 :: tutorial, DART_LAB, and various updates.  Revision: 11696
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- bring the DART tutorial pdf slides up to date with the current release.

- include new GUIs with adaptive inflation options in DART_LAB:
  oned_model_inf.m
  run_lorenz_96_inf.m

- added the lorenz_96_2scale model - additional kinds of 
  QTY_SMALL_SCALE_STATE and QTY_LARGE_SCALE_STATE added as required.

- add useful attributes to the variables in the diagnostic files

- updates and minor bug fixes to the matlab diagnostic scripts

- updates to the default input.nmls for models

- updates to the cam-fv shell scripts to work with the cesm 2.0 framework

- updates to the cam-fv model_mod for support of cam-chem variables
  Added more QUANTITIES/KINDS for chemistry species.
  Removed support for 'stand-alone' CAM and CAM-SE (cam-se will be a separate 'model'). 

- major bug fix in the simple_advection model_mod: Fixed an error with 
  the layout of the state vector. 

- obs_def_radar_mod: Fixed a serious bug in the fall velocity forward operator.
  If the fall speed field is not in the state the test for a bad istatus from 
  the interpolate() call was looking at the wrong variable and returning ok 
  even if interpolate() had set bad values.

- bug fix in the wrf model_mod for fields which have a vertical stagger

- fix to the makefiles for the GSI2DART observation converter

- added additional netcdf and location utility routines

- various fixes to documentation and test code

- renamed QTY_RAW_STATE_VARIABLE to QTY_STATE_VARIABLE  (RAW is redundant)

- direct_netcdf_mod: Renamed 'limit_mem' to 'buffer_state_io'.
  buffer_state_io is now a logical that states if a variable that tells 
  DART it it should read and write variables all at once or variable-by-variable.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ June 27rd 2017 :: CICE 5, model_mod_check, tutorial.  Revision: 11770 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Updated support for CICE5.

Updated support for model_mod_check - now compatible with netCDF input files, 
input is through [input,output]_state_files namelist variable 
(variables renamed).

Ensured consistency between low-order namelists and the updated DART tutorial.
Updated documentation of many namelists. More to come.

location_mod: namelist variable 'maintain_original_vert' was deprecated, 
it is now removed.  You must remove it from your existing namelists or 
DART will error out right away.

obs_diag: namelist variables 'rat_cri' and 'input_qc_threshold' have been 
deprecated for years, they have been removed. You must remove them from 
your existing namelists or obs_diag will error out right away.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ July 7th 2017 :: cam-fv, MPAS-ATM scripts, single file i/o.  Revision: 11807
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

models/mpas_atm: scripts completely revised for the Manhattan release.
Many thanks to Soyoung Ha and Ryan Torn for the contributed code.

cam-fv:  scripts and model_mod.f90 updated for cesm2_0_beta05.

Single File I/O:

  Now we are able to run 'single_file_in' and 'single_file_out' with MPI.

  single_file_io_mod.f90 has been removed and its functionality has been moved 
  to direct_netcdf_mod.f90.

  single_file_io_mod.f90 has been removed from all of the path_names_* files
  in the repository.  (Remove it from any private path_names_* files.)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ July 18 2017 :: bug fixes, documentation updates.  Revision: 11830 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- fixed bug in obs_impact_tool when generating the run-time table.  specifying
  a generic quantity resulted in selecting the wrong specific obs types.

- fixed a bug that would not allow filter to start from a single ensemble member
  if single_file_in was true.

- updates to HTML documentation especially for types/quantities (replacing kinds)

- updates to input.nml namelists, code comments, and shell scripts where
  names changed from 'restart' to 'state' for input and output files.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Aug 2 2017 :: single filenames, random distributions, bug fixes.  $Revision: 11863 $
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- added code to support listing input and output filenames directly in the
  namelist instead of having to go through an indirect text file.  most useful
  for programs that take a single input and output file, but works for all cases.

- bug fix in location_io_mod.f90 that affected obs_seq_to_netcdf (error in adding
  vertical location types to output file).

- fix to convert_gpsro_bufr.f90 converter (GPS obs from BUFR files) that failed
  if r8 defined to be r4.

- added draws from gamma, inverse gamma, and exponential distributions to the
  random sequence module.

- various updates to the CAM scripts to work more smoothly with the most
  recent CIME changes and DART Manhattan updates.

- added QTY_CWP_PATH and QTY_CWP_PATH_ZERO to the default quantities list for
  the obs_def_cwp_mod.f90 forward operator.

- improved some error messages in the diagnostic matlab scripts
