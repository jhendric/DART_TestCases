gsi_to_dart.f90: the main program
dart_obs_seq_mod.f90: the DART obs_seq output subroutine
params.f90: same module name as GSI/enkf/params.f90 but with different content. The purpose is to avoid modifying enkf/read*.f90
radinfo.f90: same module name as GSI/radinfo.f90 but with different content. The purpose is to avoid modifying enkf/read*.f90
mpisetup.f90: same module name as GSI/enkf/mpisetup.f90 but with different content. The purpose is to avoid dependency on GSI.

The files that are copied directly from GSI/enkf without modifications

DART modifications:
   modified ../../../obs_def/DEFAULT_obs_def_mod.F90
   modified ../../../obs_kind/DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90
   modified ../../../preprocess/preprocess.f90
   Added   ../../../obs_def/obs_def_radiance_mod.f90 which has radiance observation types




ISSUES:

1) Radiance and surface pressure bias correction
2) Surface pressure altimeter adjustment?
3) Specific humidity obs are transformed to relative humidity.  What to do? [Just run EnSRF with psuedo_rh=.false. and assimilate RH obs]
4) DART must use W and PH as control variables [okay, EnSRF can do this too (nvars=6 for WRF-ARW)]
5) Does DART not do vertical localization for surface obs?

     ! If which_vert has no vertical definition for either location do only horizontal
     if(loc1%which_vert == VERTISUNDEF .or. loc2%which_vert == VERTISUNDEF) comp_h_only = .true.
     ! If both verts are surface, do only horizontal
     if(loc1%which_vert == VERTISSURFACE .and. loc2%which_vert == VERTISSURFACE) comp_h_only = .true.
