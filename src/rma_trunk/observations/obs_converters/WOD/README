The original data files were yearly, by instrument,
downloaded from http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds285.0/

We are using the STD files, which are on standard depth
levels, and not the OBS files, which are raw and in many
cases too dense in the vertical to be independent measurements.

Look for the yearly_XXX_STD.tar files - there are about
10 different types of obs, plus documentation.

run wod_to_obs on them (in the shell_scripts dir, see runyear.ksh).

then on either the DASG cluster or bluefire, go into:

/ptmp/dart/Obs_sets/WOD/progs

and see the makedaily.sh file for how to break the full year
of data into daily obs files.  it has code to roll over year
and month boundaries.  the files are daily, centered on 0Z,
and so run from 12-24Z the previous day and then 0-12Z on the
current day.
