<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
The <a href="http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu">COSMIC</a> project provides data from 
a series of satellites.  There are two forms of the data that are used by 
DART: GPS Radio Occultation data and Electron Density.  The programs in this 
directory extract the data from the distribution files and put them into 
DART observation sequence (obs_seq) file format.
</P>
<H3>Radio Occultation</H3>
<P>
The COSMIC satellites measure the phase delay caused by deviation of the
straight-line path of the GPS satellite signal as it passes through the 
Earth's atmosphere when the GPS and COSMIC
satellites rise and set relative to each other.
This deviation results from changes in the angle of refraction of light
as it passes through regions of varying density of atmosphere.
These changes are a result of variations in the temperature,
pressure, and moisture content.
Vertical profiles of temperature and moisture can be derived as 
the signal passes through more and more atmosphere 
until it is obscured by the earth's horizon.
There are thousands of observations each day
distributed around the globe, including in areas which
previously were poorly observed.
These data are converted with the <em class=code>convert_cosmic_gps_cdf.f90</em>
program and create DART observations of GPSRO_REFRACTIVITY.
</P>

<H3>Electron Density</H3>
<P>
The COSMIC satellites also provide ionospheric profiles of electron density.
The accuracy is generally about 10<sup>-4</sup> &sim; 10<sup>-5</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>.
These data are converted with the <em class=code>convert_cosmic_ionosphere.f90</em>
program and create DART observations tagged as COSMIC_ELECTRON_DENSITY.

<H2>DATA SOURCES</H2>

<P>
Data from the
<a href="http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu">COSMIC</a> Program
are available by signing up on the
<a href="http://cosmic-io.cosmic.ucar.edu/cdaac">data access</a>
web page.  We prefer delivery in
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF</a>
file format.
<P>

<H3>Radio Occultation</H3>
<P>
The files we use as input to these conversion programs are
the Level 2 data, Atmospheric Profiles (filenames include
the string 'atmPrf').
<br />
<br />
Currently each vertical profile is stored in a separate file,
and there are between 1000-3000 profiles/day, so converting a day's
worth of observations involves downloading many individual files.
There are plans in place by the data providers to bundle these 
profiles together in a tar file to make it simpler to download the raw data.
<br />
<br />
The scripts in the <em class=file>shell_scripts</em> directory now
by default try to download profiles from any of the available
satellites that return GPS RO data to the CDAAC web site.  See the
<em class=file>do_convert.csh</em> script for a list of what 
satellites are checked by default.
</P>

<H3>Electron Density</H3>
<P>
The files we have used as input to these conversion programs are from 
the COSMIC 2013 Mission and have a data type of 'ionPrf'.
<br />
<br />
The file naming convention and file format are described by COSMIC 
<a href=' http://cdaac-www.cosmic.ucar.edu/cdaac/cgi_bin/fileFormats.cgi?type=ionPrf'>here</a> 
and there can be more than 1000 profiles/day, so converting a day's
worth of observations involves downloading many individual files.
COSMIC has instructions on ways to download the data at<br />

<H2>PROGRAMS</H2>

<H3>convert_cosmic_gps_cdf</H3>
<P>
The data are distributed in
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF</a>
file format.  DART requires all observations to be in a proprietary
format often called DART "obs_seq" format.
The files in this directory (a combination
of C shell scripts and a Fortran source executable)
do this data conversion.
<br />
<br />
The shell_scripts directory contains several example scripts, including one 
which downloads the raw data files a day at a time (<em class=program>download_script.csh</em>), 
and one which executes the conversion program (<em class=program>convert_script.csh</em>).  
These scripts make 6 hour files by default, but have options for other times.  
Each profile is stored in a separate netcdf file and there are usually
between 1000-3000 files/day, so the download process can be
lengthy.  You probably want to download as a separate preprocess step
and do not use the script options to automatically delete the input files.
Keep the files around until you are sure you are satisified with the
output files and then delete them by hand.
<br />
<br />
The conversion executable <em class=program>convert_cosmic_gps_cdf</em>, 
reads the namelist
<A HREF="#Namelist"> <em class=code>&amp;convert_cosmic_gps_nml</em> </A>
from the file <em class=file>input.nml</em>.
<br />
<br />
The namelist lets you select from one of two different forward
operators.  The 'local' forward operator computes the expected
observation value at a single point: the requested height at the
tangent point of the ray between satellites.  The 'non-local' operator
computes values along the ray-path and does an integration to get
the expected value.  The length of the integration segments and
height at which to end the integration are given in the namelist.
In some experiments the difference between the two types of
operators was negligible.  This choice is made at the time of
the conversion, and the type of operator is stored in the observation,
so at runtime the corresponding forward operator will be used to
compute the expected observation value.
<br />
<br />
The namelist also lets you specify at what heights you want
observations to be extracted.  The raw data is very dense in
the vertical; using all values would not results in a set of
independent observations.  The current source code no longer
does an intermediate interpolation; the original profiles
appear to be smooth enough that this is not needed.  The requested
vertical output heights are interpolated directly from the full profile.
</P>

<H3>convert_cosmic_ionosphere</H3>
<P>
Each profile is interpolated to a set of desired levels that are specified at run time.
During the conversion process, each profile is checked for negative values of 
electron density above the minimum desired level. If negative values are found,
the entire profile is discarded. If an observation sequence file already exists,
the converter will simply add the new observations to it. Multiple profiles may
be converted in a single execution, so it is easy to consolidate all the profiles
for a single day into a single observation sequence file, for example.
<br />
<br />
<em class=program>convert_cosmic_ionosphere</em>
reads the namelist
<A HREF="#Namelist"> <em class=code>&amp;convert_cosmic_ionosphere_nml</em> </A>
from the file <em class=file>input.nml</em>.
<br />
<br />
The original observation times are preserved in the conversion process. If it is
desired to subset the observation sequence file such that observations too far away
from desired assimilation times are rejected, a separate post-processing step
using the <a href='obs_sequence_tool.html'>obs_sequence_tool</a> is required.
A script will be necessary to take a start date, an end date, an assimilation
time step, and a desired time 'window' - and strip out the unwanted observations from
a series of observation sequence files.
<br />
<br />
There are multiple ways of specifying the observation error variance at run 
time. They are implemented in a routine named 
<em class=code>electron_density_error()</em> and are selected by the namelist
variable <em class=code>observation_error_method</em>.

<blockquote>
I-Te Lee: " ... the original idea for error of ionospheric observation is 1%. Thus, I 
put the code as "oerr = 0.01_r8 * obsval". Liu et. al and Yue et al investigated 
the Abel inversion error of COSMIC ionosphere profile, both of them figure out 
the large error would appear at the lower altitude and push model toward wrong 
direction at the lower ionosphere while assimilating these profiles.
On the other hand, the Abel inversion error depends on the ionospheric electron 
density structure, which is a function of local time, altitude and geomagnetic latitude.
To simplify the procedure to define observation error of profiles, Xinan Yue help 
me to estimate an error matrix and saved in the file which named 'f3coerr.nc'. 
...
The number in the matrix is error percentage (%), which calculated by OSSE.  
Here are two reference papers.  In the end, the observation error consists of 
instrumentation error (10%) and Abel error."

<P>
It is possible to create observation sequence files for perfect model 
experiments that have realistic observation sampling patterns and observation
error variances that <strong>do not have any actual electron densities</strong>. 
The COSMIC data files are read, but the electron density information is not 
written.  Keep in mind that some methods of specifying the observation error 
variance require knowledge of the observation value. If the observation 
value is bad or the entire profile is bad, no observation locations are 
created for the profile.

<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2>
<P>
Some COSMIC files seem to have internal times which differ from the
times encoded in the filenames by as much as 2-3 minutes.  If it is
important to get all the observations within a particular time window
files with filenames from a few minutes before and after the window 
should be converted.
Times really outside the window can be excluded in a separate step using the
<a href="../../../assimilation_code/programs/obs_sequence_tool/obs_sequence_tool.html">obs_sequence_tool</a>.

<H2>ERRORS</H2>
<P>
The converters have a parameter declaring the maximum number of desired 
levels as 200. If more than 200 levels are entered as input
(to <em class=code>obs_levels</em>), a rather uninformative run-time 
error is generated:
</P>
<pre>
 ERROR FROM:
  routine: check_namelist_read
  message:  INVALID NAMELIST ENTRY:  / in namelist convert_cosmic_ionosphere_nml
</pre>
<P>
Your error may be different if <em class=code>obs_levels</em> is not the
last namelist item before the slash '/'

<H2>FUTURE PLANS</H2>
<P>
<em class=program>convert_cosmic_gps_cdf</em> currently bins the data 
into 200 vertical bins as a first step, and then reinterpolates again 
onto the requested vertical heights.
The original intent was to smooth out any noise in the dense profiles
before interpolating onto the final heights, but plots have shown that
the original data is smooth and can be used directly.  There are plans
to remove the intermediate binning step.
<br />
<br />
Write a script that will take a start date, an end date, an assimilation
time step, and a desired time 'window' - and strip out the unwanted 
observations from a series of observation sequence files. This will be
useful for windowing the COSMIC_ELECTRON_DENSITY observations from
<em class=program>convert_cosmic_ionosphere</em>.
