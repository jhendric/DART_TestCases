Great. You can find restart files here:

/glade/scratch/terrat/wrfdart_new/cycled/output_cycled/2010061223/DART

And the WRF template and observation files here:
/glade/scratch/terrat/wrfdart/0UTCstart/output_start/2010061300

Finally, you might want an input.nml to go along with these:
/glade/scratch/terrat/wrfdart_new/cycled/output_cycled/2010061300/input.nml
(This nml has a cutoff appropriate for the radar observation assimilation pass. For conventional, suggest you use cutoff = 0.1)


There are two domains (one nested within the other), and two sets of observations since we have been using a two-pass approach, one call to filter with conventional observations and another with radar. The radar observations are contained within the smaller nest domain, and use much more aggressive localization than the conventional observations. Attempts to assimilate both radar and conventional at the same time with the conventional broad localization would exceed wall clock limits back on bluefire (where this project began). I don't think this has been attempted on yellowstone, but if you want to test some load balance algorithms, this might be a fun set to work with.
