Large Test Case WRF

2 domains, model_size = 184,125,294

There are two domain (one nested within the other), and two sets of observations
since we have been using a two-pass approach, one call to filter with 
conventional observations and another with radar.  The radar observations are 
contained within the smaller nested domain, and use much more aggressive 
localization than the conventional observations.
